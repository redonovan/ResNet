# ResNet
<b>Implementation</b>

Implemented in PyTorch 1.11.0 directly from the ResNet paper (<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385>He, et al. 2015</a>).  My code, available in <a href=https://github.com/redonovan/ResNet/blob/main/resnet.py>resnet.py</a>, follows Section 4.2 of the paper and is trained on the CIFAR-10 image dataset.  My results are shown as TensorBoard plots:
